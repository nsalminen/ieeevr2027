       Dedicated and enthusiastic student volunteers (SVs) are crucial for the organization of a successful conference. Serving as a student volunteer is also a great chance to meet and interact with scientists from the field of Virtual Reality. 
    </p>
    <p>
       Volunteering for VR 2026 is also an opportunity to gain academic service experience—an often-critical component of post graduate work—and valuable experience for future scientific event organization.
    </p>
    <p>
       We look forward to receiving your application for IEEE VR 2026!
    </p>
    <h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>free registration*</li>
            <li>hotel accommodation for non-local volunteers when possible (shared with one or two other SVs)</li>

    </p>
    <h2 id="expectations"> Expectations</h2>
    <p>
        This year, IEEE VR will take place in Daegu, Korea. You must be willing to work about 25 to 30 hours during the conference. Furthermore, you must be available for SV orientation on Friday, March 20th, before the conference begins. Your SV duties will include working the registration desk on-site, helping with the setup of the conference environment, providing assistance to speakers and attendees, and more. If you cannot commit yourself to this time frame and this amount of work, then please do not take away a slot from another willing student.
    </p>
    <h2 id="eligibility"> Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
       All full-time undergraduate and graduate students interested in Virtual Reality or related disciplines are eligible. We will consider geographic distance from the conference as well as diversity in the area of research.
    </p>
