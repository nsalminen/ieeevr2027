  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>Immersive experiences have the unique power to bridge the past, present, and future by engaging the senses and emotions in ways that transcend traditional storytelling. By blending cutting-edge technology with historical narratives and forward-thinking concepts, including artificial intelligence and creative machines, they allow to step into the lives of those before us, understand our current world more deeply, and imagine what lies ahead. Whether through virtual reality recreations of ancient civilizations, interactive museum exhibits, or futuristic simulations, these experiences create a continuum that connects memory, awareness, and aspiration. They do not just tell a story—they let us live it, fostering empathy, insight, maybe fear, and innovation across time. The digital storm the world is currently witnessing is reshaping our relationship to the past and present, confronting our own vision of our future.</p>
  <h1>TOPICS and SCOPE</h1>
  <p>As part of IEEE VR 2026, we are delighted to invite you to the second edition of the ‘XR Gallery’, fostering bridges between people from the XR and Art communities through this art exhibition, titled <strong>"(Re)Imagine: Bridging the Past, Present and Future through Immersive Experiences".</strong> We aim to provoke creative thought and discussion between artists and researchers through digital experiences around our role in shaping the world and society through ages. By bridging the gap between the XR research community and the art world, we hope to inspire innovative perspectives and foster a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between technology and our world. Some of the potential questions which can be explored in this respect are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How can immersive experiences help us emotionally connect with traditions and cultures?</li>
    <li>What lessons from the past are best understood through experiential storytelling or simulation?</li>
    <li>How do immersive experiences change our perception of time and continuity between past, present, and future?</li>
    <li>What ethical considerations arise when recreating historical or future scenarios in immersive formats?</li>
    <li>Can immersive experiences be used as tools to forecast or even influence the future? How?</li>
    <li>How might emerging technologies like AI, VR, and AR evolve to deepen our connection to history and shape our vision of the future?</li>
    <li>How can immersive experiences raise society's awareness of the current ecological crisis and its impact on the future?</li>
  </ul>
  <p> The exhibition will primarily focus on interactive XR art installations, while also welcoming non-XR art installations, such as performances or any other digital media questioning not only the link between our past, present and future in our increasingly digital world, but also more technical aspects such as how XR technologies would open new ways of artistic presentation or how to incorporate real-time human interactions in XR artwork.</p>
  <p> Accepted submissions will be showcased at the dedicated space for the XR Gallery during the entire duration of the IEEE VR conference, excluding the days of workshops<strong> (March 21-25, 2026, Daegu, South Korea)</strong>. Discussions are underway to arrange a public exhibition in the days following the conference, maybe in the city as well. </p>
