    <b>Want to become an XR faculty member OR level up your existing academic career? Join us at the Future Faculty Forum (F3) at IEEE VR!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
       We are excited to host the sixth meeting of the XR Future Faculty Forum. This Forum aims to foster a vibrant community of scholars and educators eager to collaborate, learn, and advance together toward or in an academic career in the XR field. At its heart, Forum meetings are a venue where colleagues can reconnect and collaboratively develop future generations of academic researchers. Forum meetings will be a means to introduce students who are interested in or curious about an academic career to professorship. Additionally, early-career faculty can hear from seasoned professors about how to improve or expand their research programs. 
<br/><br/>
You can expect the following at F3 meetings:

        <ol>
            <li><span class="bold">Engaging Sessions</span>: Delve into thought-provoking presentations and discussions led by distinguished experts at the forefront of XR in academia.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Mentorship and Networking</span>: Connect with experienced faculty, postdocs, and senior graduate students who have successfully integrated their interests into academic careers. Build meaningful connections, seek guidance, and explore potential collaboration opportunities.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Professional Development</span>: Acquire valuable insights and resources for career development in academia. Gain guidance on navigating the academic job market, establishing your research profile, and cultivating a successful academic career that embraces XR technologies. </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
    F3 has been a part of each IEEE ISMAR and IEEE VR conference since ISMAR 2023. We will continue to convene at future ISMAR and VR conferences and are looking for ways to expand beyond conference happenings.

    <h2 id="overview">Overview & Goals</h2>
    <p>
        This forum meeting is designed to foster mentorship, education, and collaboration among students curious about eventually becoming AR/VR (or XR) faculty.
    </p>
    <p> 
     The meeting of the Future Faculty Forum at ISMAR 2025 will feature <strong>panels and tutorials</strong> with current professors about various aspects of professorship, such as tenure, creating and organizing a research program, teaching, and professional service, and more generally, what aspects of their profession they like and dislike, and why. We will attempt to include professors (on the panels) who have also worked in industry and therefore have some basis for comparison. Additionally, the forum will include <strong>“speed advising” sessions</strong> in which students will have several short advising sessions with current faculty. In this portion, students will be able to ask more specific questions about a particular professor's experience while learning from a breadth of experiences. While brief, these meetings will help form relationships between students, junior faculty, and professors, and participants can continue their conversations later in the forum and conference. The panels and speed advising sessions will feature diverse faculty to provide students with various perspectives on the meaning of, success within, and preparation for professorship. Throughout the forum, there will be an emphasis on creating and sustaining an academic environment that is diverse, equitable, inclusive, and accessible.
    </p>
    <h2 id="format">Forum Format</h2>
    <p>
       The XR Future Faculty Forum meeting will be in-person and consist of interactive tutorials, multiple panels with group discussions, and one-on-one mentoring sessions.

    </p>
    <p>
      The interactive tutorials will detail the preparation of professor application materials and the interview process. For instance, we will review an ideal CV and discuss the importance of a cover letter. We will also see examples of research, teaching, and diversity statements, and critique them as a group. Further, the tutorials will introduce F3 attendees to details about the professor job cycle, e.g., when the job cycle opens, how long it lasts, and how to read calls for professor positions. We will also cover what happens once the application is submitted, e.g., what to expect at a virtual interview, and how to prepare for an in-person interview. Finally, we will cover aspects of negotiating a job offer.


    </p>
    <p>
     Each panel will be centered on a specific aspect related to being a professor (e.g., a panel on how to manage a research lab, a panel on dealing with the challenges of interdisciplinary research). For each panel, we will briefly introduce the panel members and the panel topic, and then move into questions and group discussions. We will have prepared some starter questions to get the discussion going, after which we will open the floor to questions and comments from the forum attendees. We will recruit professors with the appropriate background to speak on the panel topic (e.g., the panel on differences in universities will include faculty from a range of institutions and countries to best represent the different perspectives on this topic).

    <p>
       We will also host a “speed advising” session to facilitate more personalised discussions. In this session, attendees will be paired with a professor for 15 minutes for a 1-on-1 conversation. This conversation allows aspiring professors to get advice regarding their specific situations and questions, unlike the more general advice from panel sessions. After each 15-minute session, attendees will be rotated out so that more people can get the chance to speak to a professor.
