<h1>How do I participate?</h1>
<p>The goal of the IEEE VR 2026 Mentorship Program is to connect newcomers to the conference (mentees) and experienced attendees (mentors) via shared interests. This program is a great networking opportunity for both mentees and mentors to learn about each other and the VR field in general!</p>
<p><a href="https://forms.gle/Sr44X62ioZ4zBbEU9" target="_blank">Mentorship Program Application</a></p>

<h1>What is involved in this program?</h1>
<p>Mentors and mentees are expected to participate in several activities together throughout the conference. Some suggested activities include:
<ul>
  <li>Attending a paper session together and discussing afterwards</li>
  <li>Meeting during coffee breaks/meals to discuss research and/or general career guidance</li>
</ul>
  We ask that the mentors also introduce their mentee(s) to at least <strong>one (1) colleague</strong> who is attending the conference. Preferably, this colleague will be someone at an institution that is different from the mentee’s to encourage further networking.<br/>
Participants will also be asked to complete a closing survey providing feedback on the program after the conference.
